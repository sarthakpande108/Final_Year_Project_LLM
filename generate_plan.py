## ðŸŽ¯ Goal Plan for {goal_name} â€“ â‚¹{goal_amount:,.0f} by {deadline_year}

### ðŸ‘¤ User Snapshot
- Name: {name} ({age}y, {profession})
- Dependents: {', '.join([d.get('relation', '') + f" ({d.get('age', '')}y)" for d in dependents]) or 'None'}
- Monthly Income: â‚¹{income:,.0f} â†’ grows 10%/yr
- Monthly Expense: â‚¹{expenses:,.0f}
- Current Savings: â‚¹{savings:,.0f} | Emergency Fund: â‚¹{emergency_fund:,.0f}
- Investments: {len(investments)} items
- Loans: {len(loans)} active (Total EMI: â‚¹{emis:,.0f}/mo)

---

### ðŸ“Š Goal Summary
- Target: â‚¹{goal_amount:,.0f} in {years_left} years
- Required SIP (assuming 13% return): â‚¹{math.ceil(sip_required):,.0f}/mo
- Current monthly surplus: â‚¹{surplus:,.0f}
- Risk Profile: {risk_label}

---

### ðŸ’° Suggested Action Plans

Generate two risk-based investment plans based on `{risk_label}` profile:
1. Moderate Plan
2. Aggressive Plan

Each plan must:
- Allocate SIP into mutual funds, stocks, gold, and fixed deposits based on dataset provided
- Justify choices based on risk and goal horizon
- Suggest SIP step-up aligned with salary growth (10%/yr)
- Include at least 3 top mutual funds and 3 stock picks from below datasets along with analysis
- Suggest term insurance if no life cover (10x income)
- Include loan optimization advice and potential savings
- Show projection table of savings growth
- Recommend how to build up emergency fund to 6x monthly expenses, if short
